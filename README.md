# Directed Control Implementation and Experiments #

In this repo I experiment with old and new algorithms for directed control.


## Requirements ##

The code is mainly built using Julia Programming. The following is required in order to run it fully:
* julia
* 	...

## Bibliography ##
The implementations in this repo is mainly built ontop of the algorithms presented in the
